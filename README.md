## Building a Decision Tree to Predict Customer Churn
Imagine you are a data analyst at a telecom company. The marketing department has noticed an increase in customer churn and needs your help to identify which customers are most likely to leave next month.

## Tasks
In this exercise, you will build a decision tree model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Customer churn refers to when a customer stops doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers by addressing their issues proactively.


## Dataset Description
We will use a synthetic dataset for this exercise. The dataset contains the following columns:

## CustomerID:  
A unique identifier for each customer.
## Age:   
The age of the customer.
## MonthlyCharge:    
The monthly bill amount for the customer.
## CustomerServiceCalls:    
The number of times the customer contacted customer service.
## Churn:   
This is our target variable, indicating whether the customer churned (Yes) or not (No).   

# Step-by-Step Instructions
## Setup the Environment:
Import necessary libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and Matplotlib for visualization.
## Create the Dataset:
Use Python to create a synthetic dataset. We'll make a small dataset for simplicity.
## Data Preparation:
Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
Further split the dataset into training and testing sets.
## Build the Decision Tree Model:
Use Scikit-learn to create a DecisionTreeClassifier.
Train the model on the training data.
## Evaluate the Model:
Make predictions on the test set.
Calculate the accuracy of the model.
## Visualize the Decision Tree:
Use Matplotlib to visualize how the decision tree makes decisions.
## Discuss the Results:
Interpret the decision tree.
Discuss how it can be used by the company to reduce customer churn.
